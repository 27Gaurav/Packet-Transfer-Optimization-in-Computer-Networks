# Packet-Transfer-Optimization-in-Computer-Networks
 I created a program to optimize packet transfer in computer networks. It determined the maximum packet size that could be successfully transferred between routers by considering link capacities. The program used graph-based modeling, Dijkstra's algorithm, and sorting techniques for efficient execution.
